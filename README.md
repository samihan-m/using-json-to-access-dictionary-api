# dictionary-api-json-communication
 Using JSON to communicate with a Dictionary API and fetch data from it.

 I had an idea where I would turn those weird phonetic letters into "normal" English letters if each English letter had a consistent, singular pronunciation. I didn't feel like inventing a new language (English but phonetically consistent) so I'm leaving it here. It's like proof that I can do basic things with APIs and JSON.

 Uses JSON and a Dictionary API.

 The communication between the program and the Dictionary API via JSON is good. It fetches a JSON object from this API, grabs the fields it needs and prints those to console.
